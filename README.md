The AI virtual mouse using eye gestures is a novel system that offers an alternative to the traditional mouse input method.
This system utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to detect and interpret eye movements and translate them into mouse movements and clicks.
The traditional mouse input method can be challenging for people with disabilities or those who prefer a more natural and intuitive input method. 
The AI virtual mouse using eye gestures aims to address these challenges by providing a system that is more accessible and user-friendly.
The system works by using a camera to track the user's eye movements, and machine learning algorithms are used to interpret these movements into mouse movements and clicks. 
This allows the user to control their computer without needing to physically move a mouse or use a touchpad.
By utilizing the latest advancements in artificial intelligence and computer vision, the AI virtual mouse using eye gestures can accurately and efficiently recognize a variety of eye gestures, including blinks, gaze direction, and pupil dilation. 
This system has the potential to greatly enhance the accessibility and usability of computers for a wide range of users, including those with physical disabilities, motor impairments, or vision impairments.
